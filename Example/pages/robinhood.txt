Marathon organisers want to set a new record for the number of "Robin Hoods" running the race.

Chris Jones, 48, from Mapperley, ran the Ikano Robin Hood Half Marathon last year in Lincoln green and a feathered Robin Hood hat.

Now he is going to be doing it all over again in September, and is encouraging other runners, and spectators, to join in the fun.

Mr Jones, who is a member of the Nottingham Sweatshop running community, said: "It was the atmosphere I enjoyed and it was a nice event. I dressed up as Robin Hood to promote the Nottingham Robin Hood link, it gives it a nice theme.

"Dressing up gives a nice, fun twist to the day. There's nothing to stop spectators dressing up as well. The more there are in costume the more fun it is really."

Last year 400 runners wore a Robin Hood costume.

This year Sweatshop – the organisers of the marathon and half marathon – are aiming to break that record.

Mr Jones said he bought his costume off the Sweatshop website, but runners are also invited to use their imagination and create their own.

He said: "It needs to be something that doesn't get too hot and is quite light. These are the key things, but have fun with it."

Chris added that at least another 40 members of the Notts Sweatshop running community will be dressing up as Robin Hood on the day.

A Sweatshop spokesman said: "We look forward to welcoming the local community to race day. With the huge excitement around the history of Nottingham and our heroic outlaw, Robin Hood, we are very excited to take on the challenge of setting a new record for the largest number of Robin Hoods running a half marathon.

"Last year, over 400 'Robins Hoods' took to the course, we hope you'll join us!"

The Ikano Robin Hood Marathon and Half Marathon will be held on September 29, starting at Victoria Embankment.
