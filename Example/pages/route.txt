THE Robin Hood half marathon has been launched with a new route which organisers describe as "fast, flat and scenic".

The route starts and ends at Victoria Embankment, and will take runners along Trent Bridge and past Nottingham Castle.

A launch event for the 13-mile race, sponsored by Ikano, which is set to take place on September 30, involved 200 runners doing a 4km stretch of the route.
